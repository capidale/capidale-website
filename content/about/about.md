We are a Yorkshire-based, grant fundraising and project evaluation consultancy, working with charities across the UK.

In just over 10 years, we have raised over £58 million for our clients. Last year, we secured them an average of £25.69 for every £1 charged in fundraising fees (£21.41 including VAT).

Our successful approach is based on truly understanding the difference our clients make to the people they support, and powerfully communicating this to funders.

We use our post-graduate research expertise to help clients measure the impact of their work, by designing simple but effective project evaluation methodologies and writing external evaluation reports.
