We are a Yorkshire-based, grant fundraising and project evaluation consultancy, working with charities across the UK.

In just 10 years, we have raised over £50 million for our clients, securing them an average of £42.31 for every £1 charged in fundraising fees.

Our successful approach is based on truly understanding the difference our clients make to the people they support, and powerfully communicating this to funders.

We use our post-graduate research expertise to help clients measure the impact of their work, by designing simple but effective project evaluation methodologies and writing external evaluation reports.
