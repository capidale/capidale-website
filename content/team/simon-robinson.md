### Simon Robinson

<p class="text-base leading-6 font-semibold text-light-green-600">Director</p>

Simon was Director of Client Services for respected fundraising agency Pell & Bales, before becoming Head of Direct Marketing for the British Red Cross.

His marketing expertise enabled him to switch temporarily to the corporate world, working for 10 years in senior product and marketing roles at GE Capital, HBOS and Santander. But Simonâ€™s true love is the voluntary sector and helping charities make a powerful case for funding their work. He set Capidale up with Louise in 2011.
