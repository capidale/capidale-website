### Louise Farnell

<p class="text-base leading-6 font-semibold text-light-green-600">Director</p>

Louise started her career as a market researcher, before working as a corporate and then major donor fundraiser for the British Red Cross. She then became Head of Fundraising at Rethink, the mental health charity where she increased voluntary income from £200,000 to over £2 million in just 5 years.

She is particularly proud to have raised £16,000,000 to kick start Time to Change, the anti-stigma mental health campaign. She has an MA in Social Research and leads our project evaluation work.
