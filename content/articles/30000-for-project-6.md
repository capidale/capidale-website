Project 6 is an award-winning voluntary sector drug and alcohol charity working across South and West Yorkshire.

The communities Project 6 works in are among England's worst areas for drug and alcohol use. They support people and families impacted by drugs and alcohol who experience multiple health, social and economic disadvantages. Annually, Project 6 supports around 9,000 people. 93% of people report improved mental health and wellbeing.

A grant from the Garfield Weston Foundation will contribute towards Project 6's essential running costs. It will enable them to respond to the growing demand for their community services following recent government investment into statutory treatment services.

Since we started working with Project 6 in 2022, we have raised over £750,000.
