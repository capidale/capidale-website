We are delighted to have raised £109,482 for Margaret Carey Foundation from The Tudor Trust, Postcode Neighbourhood Trust and The Brelms Trust.

Margaret Carey Foundation support adults and young people identified as being at high-risk of future involvement in criminality, or who are already in prison. Their work combines a social purpose with an environmental ethos, empowering marginalised people to learn new skills by refurbishing bikes that would otherwise end up in landfill.

In 2020, Margaret Carey Foundation's founder and Chief Executive retired after 10 years. A grant of £75,000 over three years from The Tudor Trust, will support the Foundation's newly appointed Chief Executive to implement their new three-year strategic development plan. The ambitious plan will create new opportunities for the Foundation to support people when they are released from prison, develop new strategic partnerships and create new income streams to secure their long-term financial sustainability after the COVID-19 pandemic.

With funding from the Postcode Neighbourhood Trust, Margaret Carey Foundation will deliver a program of cycling activities for young people and their families living in the most deprived community of Bradford. The grant of £20,000 will support 150 people providing them with opportunities to participate in physical activity, improve their mental wellbeing and feel more connected to their community.

Finally, a grant of £15,000 over three years from The Brelms Trust will support the Margaret Carey Foundation's Community Development Officer to continue and expand activities for young people identified by Bradford’s Youth Offending and Youth Services Teams as being at high risk of future involvement in crime.
