The Hope Foundation work in the heart of one of England's most deprived and lowest-skilled communities, Middlesbrough.

In Middlesbrough, half of the local government wards are in the 10% most deprived nationally; unemployment is twice the national average, almost one in four people claim universal credit, and 40% of young people do not have a GCSE equivalent qualification in Maths and/or English.

The Hope Foundation helps over 300 of the worst affected people find a way out every year. They provide adult learning and intensive, one-to-one career advice. Three-in-four people they support are asylum seekers and refugees - many speak little or no English.

Earlier this year, Sue Kearney, Chief Executive, asked us to help the charity with their trusts and foundations fundraising. Our prospect research identified the Garfield Weston Foundation as our first application.

We are delighted our application has been successful. The Garfield Weston Foundation's grant of £30,000 will contribute to The Hope Foundation's running costs over the next 12 months, helping them to maintain capacity for their vital work.

We look forward to continuing our work with The Hope Foundation and raising additional funding.
