Over the last 105 years, Broughton House have provided person-centred residential care in their comfortable, home-from-home environment to more than 8,000 elderly Armed Forces veterans who can no longer live independently. Over the last few years, their traditional care home has been transformed into a state-of-the-art Veteran Care Village, due for completion later this year.

Alongside their residential care, Broughton House support around 80 younger veterans through their Support Hub, with a focus on counselling and welfare advice to veterans struggling with mental health and addiction problems, which have often stemmed from their traumatic experiences in service. 

Like many care homes, Broughton House has struggled through the Covid-19 pandemic, and have admitted that the last 18 months have been the most challenging times they have faced in their 105 years of service. 

We started working with Broughton House in June this year, after their newly appointed CEO – Karen Miller – contacted us for support with their fundraising efforts and found ourselves celebrating a success instantly!

We’re delighted to report that our first three applications, to the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust, the Veterans Foundation and the Zochonis Charitable Trust, have been successful – raising £160,000 for our newest client!

We are so pleased to have been able to help this amazing organisation and hope to work alongside them for many years to come.
