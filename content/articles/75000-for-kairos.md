We are thrilled to have raised £75,000 for Kairos Women Working Together (Kairos WWT) from the Lloyds Bank Foundation.

Kairos WWT is a specialist organisation in Coventry run by women, for women. They help women who are subject to or at risk of sexual exploitation through holistic, trauma informed, long term support and advocacy. They empower women to increase their safety, stability, self-belief, and self-reliance; improve their life chances, and build fulfilled lives, free from violence, abuse and exploitation. 

The women supported by Kairos have all experienced trauma and struggle with its lasting impact. The majority were subjected to at least one form of childhood abuse, and many have never experienced a safe, loving relationship. Most are routinely subjected to at least one form of violence and abuse: sexual violence, domestic violence, and/or coercive control.

Since starting to work with Kairos WWT in 2022, we have almost raised £950,000 through 7 successful funding applications. We look forward to continue working with Kairos and raising additional funding.
