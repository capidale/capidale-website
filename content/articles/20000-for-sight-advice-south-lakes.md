Sight Advice South Lakes is a member-led charity based in Kendal supporting visually impaired people across the largely rural area of South Lakeland. They support over 500 people with sight loss annually, helping them to build supportive relationships, improve their wellbeing, and live independently.

People with sight loss are more likely to suffer from poor quality of life, depression, financial hardship, and social isolation. An estimated 5,100 people live with sight loss in South Lakeland. Sight Advice South Lakes empower over 70% of people they support to improve their wellbeing.

We have successfully raised £20,000 for Sight Advice South Lakes from the Garfield Weston Foundation. This grant will go towards meeting their essential running costs this year so they can continue to provide support to people with sight loss in South Lakeland. 

We have now raised almost £500,000 for Sight Advice South Lakes through seven successful funding applications since we started working with them in 2018. We look forward to continuing our work with them and raising additional funding.
