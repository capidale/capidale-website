Bradford faces some of the most pressing mental health challenges in England, with particularly high rates of common mental health conditions, "sections", and psychosis.

The Cellar Trust supports nearly 12,000 people with mental health problems every year across Bradford, Airedale, Wharfedale and Craven. With a nationally recognised, award-winning model built on lived experience, their peer-led approach helps people navigate crisis, build resilience, and regain independence.

Thanks to funding from Yorkshire Building Society, The Cellar Trust will deliver a new three-year programme offering personalised support to 240 unemployed people with mental health problems. Most participants will be economically inactive or classed as NEET (not in education, employment or training). All will receive intensive, one-to-one support from trained Peer Support Workers who bring their own lived experience of mental ill-health to the role.

This support will go far beyond mental health. The programme will help individuals develop self-care routines, address financial insecurity, build job readiness, and, crucially, receive three months of support once they secure employment.

Delivery will focus on four Bradford wards - Clayton & Fairweather Green, Great Horton, Little Horton, and Royds. The Cellar Trust will partner with trusted local community groups to ensure they reach those facing the greatest barriers, including people affected by complex trauma.
