Launchpad is a small, highly impactful charity providing accommodation/support to homeless UK Armed Forces’ veterans.

The transition from leaving the armed forces and returning to civilian life will be smooth for most veterans. Still, those few who can’t resettle will be faced with challenges such as homelessness, poverty, health issues, addictions, broken families and unemployment. 

Launchpad's projects in Liverpool, Durham, and Newcastle accommodate 98 homeless people at a time. Since 2013, they have supported over 700 veterans. They provide up to two years’ accommodation and support to address complex needs, including a self-contained flat, psychotherapy, intensive support to find employment and long-term housing, and ongoing support once veterans leave.  

We are delighted to have raised £90,000 for Launchpad from The Forrester Family Trust. This grant will part-fund the provision of accommodation and support to 294 homeless people over the next three years. Everyone supported by the grant will have multiple and complex needs.   

Since we started working with Launchpad in 2017, we have raised almost £3,000,000 across 88 successful funding applications. We look forward to continuing to work with AF&V Launchpad in the future.
