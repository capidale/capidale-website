For over 25 years, Barca-Leeds has been supporting adults, young people and families in Leeds’ most deprived communities. All the people they support have multiple complex issues, including drug/alcohol misuse, mental health problems, unemployment and low skills.

Ever year, Barca empower over 15,000 people to lead their best life. They run a wide range of targeted services including:

- support for over 2,000 young people annually through their Counselling and Emotional Wellbeing service and youth programmes.
- intensive, holistic support for adults with substance misuse and housing problems, such as addressing the underlying causes of frequent use of emergency care services.
- community-based activities and groups to improve health and wellbeing and employability, and rebuild family relationships in West Leeds.

Earlier this year, Helen Hart, Managing Director of Barca, asked us to help the charity with trusts and foundation fundraising. Through our prospect research, we identified the Garfield Weston Foundation as our first application.

We are delighted our application has been successful. The Garfield Weston Foundation's grant of £30,000 will contribute to Barca's running costs over the next 12 months, helping them to their maintain capacity for their vital work.

We look forward to continuing to work with Barca to raise additional funding.
