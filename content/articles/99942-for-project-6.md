We are delighted to have raised £99,921 for Project 6 from the National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme.

Project 6 support people, families and communities affected by drug and alcohol problems who experience multiple economic and social disadvantages in Keighley, Sheffield and Doncaster. They provide opportunities and choices which empower people to make positive life changes, which are meaningful and sustainable and match their personal goals.

In 2021, we were contacted by Chief Executive, Vicki Beere, to help secure funding from the National Lottery to continue delivering their WaVE at Progress service in Keighley. Project 6 were already through to Stage 2, but needed support writing a full application. 

WaVE provides long-term support for people in the early stages of their recovery, often after leaving statutory drug and alcohol treatment services. People in recovery work alongside a trained Recovery Worker and volunteers with lived experience to build their recovery capital to help move away from harmful behaviours. They develop a goals-orientated plan combining one-to-one support and peer-led group activities. Gradually, as their confidence and resilience increases, WaVE supports people to gain qualifications, volunteers in their local community and access training and employment.

We are delighted our application has been successful and over the next 12 months 250 people will benefit from WaVE.
