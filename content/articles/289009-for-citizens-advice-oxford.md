Citizens Advice Oxford has been supporting people in Oxford for 84 years providing free advice on a wide range of issues. 

The cost-of-living crisis has exacerbated financial difficulties. Citizens Advice Oxford has seen a 43% increase in demand for food bank referrals/emergency relief. 215% more people have needed support with energy bills. 

We recently raised £289,009 from The National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme to support people experiencing difficulty due to the cost-of-living and local housing affordability crises. Over three years, 1,230 people and families experiencing a financial crisis will be supported with information and advice on long term solutions. 

Citizens Advice Oxford is the only organisaton providing advice in the areas of Oxford targeted by this project. 75% of the people supported by Citizens Advice Oxford through this project will feel less stressed, depressed or anxious.
