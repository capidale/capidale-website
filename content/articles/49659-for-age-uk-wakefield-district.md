We are delighted to have raised £49,659 for Age UK Wakefield from national Age UK's Intervention Innovation Grant Fund application.

Age UK Wakefield & District help around 10,000 older people in their community overcome loneliness, poverty and ill-health. They do this by providing information and advice to all older people who need it and holistic, person-centered support to those experiencing a crisis.

This funding from national Age UK will support Age UK Wakefield's Dementia Enhanced Carer’s Support (DECS) project. The project will fill the substantial gap between the end of Maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (MCST), and the point when a person’s dementia progresses beyond their carer’s ability to support them, and they need professional care. 

The DECS project is specifically designed to improve the capacity and capability of carers to support a person with dementia, as their dementia progresses from mild/moderate towards more severe. 

This the latest of 19 successful funding applications we have made for Age UK Wakefield, raising almost £1,500,000. We look forward to continuing to work with Age UK Wakefield and raising further funds for them.
