Wakefield is a deprived area where the rates of older people living in poverty is almost double the national average. On top of this, the life expectancy is amongst the lowest in England. 

Age UK Wakefield promote the wellbeing of all older people in their community and to help make life fulfilling and enjoyable. We are delighted to have raised £191,900 from from the Henry Smith Charity to support the charity achieve their mission.

This grant from the Henry Smith Charity will enable Age UK Wakefield's befriending service to continue for another three years. The service matches socially isolated older people with volunteers to reduce levels of loneliness. Thanks to the support of Henry Smith's the befriending service will support 660 isolated older people over the next three years.
