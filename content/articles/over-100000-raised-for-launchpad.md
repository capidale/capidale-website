Launchpad provide up to two years' housing and support to help homeless veterans of the UK armed forces rebuild their lives. They run projects in Liverpool and Newcastle, supporting around 130 veterans every year.

The veterans Launchpad work with are amongst the most marginalised people in the UK. Most were previously sleeping on the streets and are long-term unemployed. Often the veterans have multiple needs, including mental health problems, which can result from their experiences during service.

We have successfully secured over £100,000 this year, to help Launchpad continue their vital work. This includes raising funds to employ an experienced mental health specialist to provide face-to-face support at a time when most services are only delivering support by phone/video. Grants include:

1. National Lottery Community Fund - Awards for All
2. Armed Forces Covenant Fund
3. The Edward Gostling Foundation
4. Medicash
5. The Morrisons Foundation
6. The Scott (Eredine) Charitable Trust
7. The Steve Morgan Foundation
8. The Evan Cornish Foundation

We're delighted to have helped Launchpad raise funds to help veterans stay focused on their recovery during this difficult time.
