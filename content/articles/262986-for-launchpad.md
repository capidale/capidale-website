Since 2013, AF&V Launchpad has been a lifeline for over 700 Armed Forces veterans struggling to adjust to civilian life. 

The veterans Launchpad support face a perfect storm of challenges - homelessness, mental health problems, and long-term unemployment - making them some of the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach ex-service personnel in the UK.

Operating in Newcastle, Liverpool, and Durham, Launchpad provides up to two years of safe, stable accommodation alongside tailored, wraparound support. 

Each veteran works with specialist staff to build a personalised plan that meets their unique needs. Support includes accessing welfare benefits, tackling addiction or mental health challenges, receiving psychotherapy, gaining work experience, and building employment skills. When the time is right, Launchpad helps each veteran move on to secure, long-term housing, continuing to offer support as they rebuild their lives.

We are proud to share that we have successfully secured £130,000 in funding from Greenwich Hospital to support Launchpad’s work. This grant will fund accommodation and intensive support for 13 Royal Navy and Royal Marines veterans over the next 12 months - veterans who are facing some of the toughest transitions from military to civilian life.

Since we began working with Launchpad in 2017, we’ve helped raise over £3.2 million across 94 successful funding applications. It’s a privilege to stand alongside an organisation doing such critical work and we look forward to continuing our partnership in the years ahead.
