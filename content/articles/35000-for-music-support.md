The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the mental health of many people working in the music industry due to income loss and prolonged uncertainly. They were the first to shut down in March 2020 and last to re-open. 

Music Support help people working in the music industry, including live events, experiencing addiction and mental health problems. They are the only charity open to everyone in the industry, including backstage crew, label executives, musicians, artists and young people starting out. As a peer-led charity, all their staff, volunteers and Trustees come from the music industry. Almost all have lived experience of mental health problems and/or addiction.

Last year, Chief Executive, Eric Mtungwazi, contacted Capidale for support with their trusts and foundations fundraising, a new area for them. 

We initially completed extensive prospect research to identify funders with an interest in supporting their core services, including telephone helpline and addiction and recovery workshops.  We also designed a snapshot survey to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people in the music industry with addiction and mental health problems. Working with partners, Music Support surveyed 121 people.

In August, we submitted applications to the Garfield Weston Foundation and the Edward Gostling Foundation – both were successful. We are particularly pleased to announce that we were granted £10,000 more than we requested from the Garfield Weston Foundation!
