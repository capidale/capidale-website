We are delighted to have raised £90,000 for Women’s Counselling and Therapy Service from The Pilgrim Trust.

Women’s Counselling and Therapy Service (WCTS) is Leeds’ only women’s specialist mental health service. They have been helping women and girls from the age of 16 to recover from the trauma of experiences including rape, violence, abuse and neglect for over 40 years. They provide counselling and psychotherapeutic services, alongside advancing education surrounding psychological/mental health problems in women and girls. 

This grant from The Pilgrim Trust will, over three years, help them support an additional 50 young women, aged 16-25 years, who have existing and entrenched mental health problems. The project will involve psychotherapeutic creative arts drop-in sessions. 

The grant was just one of 11 projects funded by the Pilgrim Trust in their 2023 grants supporting young women’s mental health in Yorkshire and the North East. 

We have now raised over £2,500,000 for Leeds Women’s Counselling and Therapy Service through 30 successful funding applications since we started working with them in 2012 – and look forward to continuing our work with WCTS and raising additional funding.
