We are delighted to announce that Cumbria's five sight loss charities have received £488,425 from the National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme.

Over the past three years, the partnership has supported over 1,400 people facing a sight loss-related crisis. Our 2023 evaluation confirmed the significant impact of this support, highlighting the development of practical living skills and improved coping mechanisms.

Building on this learning, the partners new project, TOGETHER, will empower and support 1,860 people with sight loss across Cumbria. Each partner will provide tailored, one-to-one support to help people adapt and thrive.

We are thrilled to have been asked to continue working with all five partners once again to evaluate the project's impact and share the inspiring stories of people who benefit.
