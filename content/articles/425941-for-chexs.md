We are delighted to have raised £425,941 for CHEXS from The National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme.

CHEXS is an award-winning youth and family support charity based in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire. CHEXS work with disadvantaged and underpeforming school-age children, and their families. They raise young people's self-esteem, skills, wellbeing, and aspirations by directly tackling the behavioural and confidence issues which stop young people from achieving their potential.

CHEXS work in partnership with local primary and secondary schools who refer families when a child isn't achieving their potential and the underlying cause is thought to be difficulties at home. Due to the cost of living crisis, twice as many families are being referred for support. This grant from The National Lottery Community Fund will enable CHEXS to meet the demand. 

CHEXS will work intensively with families for 3-6 months, co-creating and implementing plans to address challenges. Regular 1-2-1 meetings will improve parent/child relationships and resolve conflict. CHEXS will also offer light-touch support to other families through food-bank vouchers and emergency fuel grants, run workshops to enhance parenting skills, and provide face-to-face and online peer support groups.

We have been working with CHEXS since 2018. This application is our 7th successful application. Other successful applications include The Henry Smith Charity and Garfield Weston Foundation.
