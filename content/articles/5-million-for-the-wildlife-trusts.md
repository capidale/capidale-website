Mid December 2021 and we were starting to wind down for Christmas, with thoughts of a much anticipated two-week holiday.

And then we received a phone call from The Wildlife Trusts, asking for our help with a large funding application to The Heritage Lottery Fund, with a very short deadline.

And so it was that we successfully secured a late Christmas present of a £5 million grant to empower disadvantaged communities across the UK to let nature flourish. This ground-breaking initiative will create a huge matrix of community-led rewilding projects – improving the lives of people from some of the most disadvantaged areas across the UK and leaving a lasting natural legacy in honour of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee.

The Wildlife Trusts will give people the skills, tools and opportunity to take action for nature across all four of the UK nations.

The grant follows on the heels of the £6.4 million we helped The Wildlife Trusts secure to help some of the country’s most disadvantaged schools bring nature to their students.
