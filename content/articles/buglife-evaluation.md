Did you know that over 97% of all flower-rich grasslands have been lost in England since the 1930s? Most invertebrate species are declining because their habitats are so fragmented and the land in between is hostile, preventing the species from travelling North to keep track with the changing climate.

Funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Buglife’s B-Lines are an imaginative and beautiful solution to the problem of lost flowers and pollinators in the UK. The B-Lines are a series of “insect pathways” running through our countryside and towns. Buglife is is working with local landowners, schools and the general public to restore and create a series of wildflower-rich habitat stepping stones to help our little friends get from A – B!

We are supporting Buglife with the monitoring and evaluation of their B-Lines projects in North Cornwall, Shropshire and Strathmore. We are helping them to measure the impact the project has on landowners, volunteers and the general public. Each project is bespoke to its location, focusing on preservation of different species, so we have tailored our evaluation for each project, including:

- Developing Logic Models
- Designing participant surveys
- Holding stakeholder interviews
- Data capture and analysis
- Writing the evaluation report

All three projects are currently hosting a range of activities, including sowing wildflower workshops, and asking participants to complete our surveys. We are looking forward to to analysing the results!

We have been offering evaluation support to clients since 2017. Over the last five years, this side of our business has blossomed, and we now support 12 clients with their impact measurement and evaluation.
