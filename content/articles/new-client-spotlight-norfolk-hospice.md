In November 2022, we were contacted by The Norfolk Hospice to see how we could help with their trusts and foundations fundraising.

The Norfolk Hospice is the only independent, adult hospice in Norfolk. They have been providing end-of-life care for people and their loved ones for almost 40 years. The Hospice supports people to e their vision of a 'good' death - whether at the Hospice's dedicated inpatient unit or at home.

The Hospice already had a well-established trusts and foundations fundraising programme, stretching back nearly 20 years. 

We began by completing an audit of past and current funders. We analysed whether the Hospice was still eligible to apply, their track record with the funder and if it was possible to increase the grant size. Finally, we developed a 12-month fundraising plan, which we are now implementing.

We are excited to be working with such a vitally important charity. When we visited the Hospice in early-2023 we were struck by how staff, patients and volunteers all felt like a family - one we are pleased to now be part of.
