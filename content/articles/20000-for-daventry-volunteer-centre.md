Since 1990, Daventry Volunteer Centre has been at the heart of its local community—supporting over 350 voluntary and community groups and helping hundreds of people find meaningful volunteering opportunities.

One of the Centre’s most impactful areas of work is its Horizon programme - a series of targeted projects designed for people who are furthest from the job market. Many of the participants have additional needs and face barriers such as poor mental health, isolation, or long-term unemployment. Through supported volunteering, they gain confidence, develop new skills, and begin to re-engage with the world of work.

We are thrilled to announce that we have successfully secured funding from Garfield Weston Foundation to help Daventry Volunteer Centre continue delivering this life-changing work. The funding will ensure that some of the most disadvantaged people in Daventry, who often live in pockets of deprivation within an otherwise affluent area, can access structured volunteering opportunities that support their journey towards greater independence and improved wellbeing.

To date, we’ve raised over £1.5 million for our clients through applications to the Garfield Weston Foundation, with an impressive 82% success rate.
