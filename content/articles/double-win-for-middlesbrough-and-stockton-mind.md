We are delighted to start 2021, with a double win for Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind raising £28,216 from the North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care System and Catalyst.

Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind support people of all ages in the Tees Valley to enjoy good mental health. They specialise in helping the most vulnerable and socially excluded people in their community - one-in-three people they support live in the 1% most deprived areas nationally. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind has been responding to a significant increase in demand for advice, information, and support.

With funding from the North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care System, Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind will support an additional 324 people who they otherwise would not be able to support this winter. The grant of £20,000 will particularly target children and young people and people with mental health problems who are close to crisis.

A grant of £8,216 from Catalyst will support Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind to work with four other mental health charities and a digital partner to innovate and explore ideas to strengthen data sharing between services to promote better social prescribing in the mental health and wellbeing sector.

These two grants combined with earlier successes in 2020, bring the total amount raised for Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind last year to £154,754.
