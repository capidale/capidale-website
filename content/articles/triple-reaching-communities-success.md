We have successfully raised a total of £1,002,300 from The National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme for Barca-Leeds, SELFA and Citizens Advice Doncaster.

Barca-Leeds supports vulnerable and disadvantages adults, young people and families living in Leeds’ most deprived communities. We are delighted to have raised £415,980 over three years to support their new Bright Horizons project.

Bright Horizons aims to breaking generational poverty and improve life chances for families in South and West Leeds. The project will support 240 jobless parents and carers who are experiencing health, social and economic barriers which stop them from finding work.

SELFA has been supporting children and their families in Craven, North Yorkshire experiencing vulnerabilities to build resilience, thrive and achieve since 2007.

We have successfully raised £299,537 to fund SELFA Go Wild. The project will supports children and young people to increase their voice, participation, and social action opportunities. SELFA Go Wild will support young people to improve their mental wellbeing by emphasising outdoor and environmental activities.

Doncaster is Yorkshire’s most vulnerable area to the cost-of-living crisis. The community experiences high levels of child poverty, fuel poverty, food insecurity and economic inactivity. 

We are therefore thrilled to have raised £286,783 for Citizens Advice Doncaster to empower 2,130 people in Doncaster with disabilities and/or long-term health conditions to successfully claim their benefit entitlements, access other support they need, and so have a better chance of achieving their potential in life.
