One of the last face-to-face meetings we attended before the first national lockdown was a trip to Wakefield to visit the amazing Well Women Centre.

Wandering into the local shopping centre to grab some lunch felt very strange as the centre was eerily quiet. A strange time to be taking on a new client perhaps but a Reaching Communities grant, which funded an entire team, was coming to an end and, simply put, people’s jobs were at stake.

As the National Lottery Community Fund froze their Reaching Communities programme, this wasn’t simply a case of going back to the same funder to request another grant. As the world entered lockdown, we pieced together a programme which would keep an essential team running for the next three years.

Just under half the women the Well Women Centre supports have experienced domestic abuse and the remainder have been exposed to other traumatic experiences including childhood sexual abuse, sex work, having children removed from their care and the Criminal Justice System.

We submitted seven funding applications, of which six were successful – securing a total of £588,264 to keep the team working for the next three years. This included a National Lottery Community Fund Reaching Communities grant when the programme re-opened. This represented enough funding to fund their casework team in full, as well as additional counselling resource to provide a seamless pathway between casework and counselling support.

Over three years, this funding will enable the teams to support 411 women. Based on previous outcomes, 94% will feel better able to cope with the emotional impact of their experiences and 80% will feel supported to engage positively with child protection proceedings, increasing the likelihood of children being returned to their care.
