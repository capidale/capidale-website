We are delighted to have raised £549,462 for Kairos from The National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme and The Henry Smith Charity.

Kairos support women in Coventry who are at risk of or subject to sexual exploitation, including those involved in street-based prostitution. They provide outreach, drop-in, crisis intervention, intensive 1-to-1 emotional and practical support and advocacy, and facilitated peer support groups. All their support is women-centred, holistic, long-term, non-judgmental and trauma-informed. They keep women safe from harm and improve their stability and self-belief. 

Funding from The National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme will support young women aged 16-25. The grant of £339,462 over three years will help young women as they become adults. This includes those moving between services for children and services for adults. 

Specialist Support & Advocacy Practitioners will provide one-to-one, holistic, practical and emotional support and advocacy to address factors which increase vulnerability to exploitation, including poverty, substance use, poor health and violence. Volunteer Peer Mentors will help young women through peer support groups and reflective sessions.

A grant of £210,000 over three years from The Henry Smith Charity will contribute to Kairos' core costs. The funding will help the charity achieve their five main goals in the next three years. One of their goals is to help more women have long-lasting positive changes in their lives.

These two grants, combined with earlier successes in 2022, bring the total amount we have raised for Kairos to £867,862, maintaining a 100% track record.
