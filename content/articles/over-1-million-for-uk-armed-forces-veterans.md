Over the last five years, we have worked with several charities supporting veterans of the UK Armed Forces, raising almost £2.5 million.

In 2022, working with two charities, Launchpad and Broughton House, we have raised £1,065,316.

**Launchpad** provide up to two years' housing and support to help homeless veterans of the UK armed forces rebuild their lives. They run projects in Liverpool, Newcastle and Durham, supporting around 100 veterans every year.

The veterans Launchpad work with are amongst the most marginalised people in the UK. Most were previously sleeping on the streets and are long-term unemployed. Launchpad is often the first safe space they have slept for months, sometimes years.

In 2022, we have successfully secured £636,905 to help Launchpad continue their work. This included grants to support the opening of a third house in Durham. Grants include:

1. The Veterans Foundation
2. Armed Forces Covenant Fund
3. The Mercers' Company

**Broughton House** provide person-centred residential care to elderly Armed Forces veterans who can no longer live independently. 

Over the last few years they have transformed their traditional care home into a state-of-the-art Veteran Care Village. This includes the north of England’s only specialist dementia care unit for veterans as well as six retirement apartments.

In 2022, we raised £428,411. Grants include:

1. ABF The Soldiers' Charity
2. Royal Navy & Royal Marines Charity
3. NHS Suicide Prevention Fund
