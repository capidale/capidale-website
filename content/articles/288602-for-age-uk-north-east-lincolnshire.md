We are delighted to have raised £288,602 of continuation funding for Age UK North East Lincolnshire from The National Lottery Community Fund's Reaching Communities programme. 

In 2019, we raised £279,288 from the National Lottery Community Fund to help people in older people in Cleethorpes, Immingham or rural areas of North East Lincolnshire. The project focused on providing early support to older people struggling to cope with major life changes, including bereavement, loss of health and mobility, social isolation, income loss or needing care. Over three years, the project supported over 700 older people.

We worked alongside Age UK North East Lincolnshire to evaluate the project. People told us the project helped them "enjoy life again" and "feel part of my community". We also found that a combination of the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis had significantly increased demand for the project.

Continuation funding from The National Lottery Community Fund will expand the project to include Grimsby and enable more older people experiencing a difficult transition to receive early help. Age UK North East Lincolnshire will support older people to adapt to these changes and build mental and physical resilience. The goal is to help people avoid a later life characterised by poverty, ill health, and loneliness.

We are looking forward to once again working alongside Age UK North East Lincolnshire to evaluate the project's transformative impact on older people's lives.
