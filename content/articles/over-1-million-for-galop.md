Galop is the UK's LGBT+ anti-abuse charity. They specialise in supporting victims and survivors of domestic abuse, sexual violence, hate crime and other forms of abuse, including so-called conversion therapies.

Galop provide advocacy and casework services as well as three national helplines. Their work is the only service of its kind in the country. Using their lived experience, Galop also work on national and local policy change to improve outcomes for LGBT+ victims and survivors of abuse and violence.

Since we started working with Galop in 2021, we have submitted eight applications, six of which have been successful. One is awaiting outcome. Successful applications include:
-£300,336 from the City Bridge Trust towards Galop’s therapy services.
-£179,268 from The Henry Smith Charity.
-£101,671 from Comic Relief
-£30,000 from the Garfield Weston Foundation.

We are looking forward to continuing to support Galop with their fundraising.
