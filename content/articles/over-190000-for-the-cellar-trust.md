<p class="text-lg font-medium">The Cellar Trust is an award winning, mental health charity based in Shipley, near Bradford. Peer support underlines everything they do, with three-quarters of front-line staff having personal experience of mental health problems.</p>

People with mental health problems have been one of the groups hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown. The Cellar Trust has experienced a 43% increase in demand for their crisis support and this work continues to operate at full capacity.

We have successfully secured over £190,000 to help The Cellar Trust continue their vital work to support people with mental health problems throughout the pandemic, through a range of grant programmes, including:

1. Coronavirus Mental Health Response Fund (managed by national Mind)
2. Garfield Weston Foundation
3. The Morrisons Foundation
4. Liz and Terry Bramall Foundation
5. The Edward Gostling Foundation
6. Legal & General Community Fund
7. Sir George Martin Trust

This funding has helped mitigate lost income in trading and community fundraising and we’re delighted to have helped them continue supporting people with mental health problems during this difficult time.
