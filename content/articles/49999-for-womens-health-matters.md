We are delighted to have raised £49,999 for Women's Health Matters from The Charles Plater Trust.

Women’s Health Matters supports women and girls from Leeds’ most disadvantaged communities to overcome inequalities. The majority have experienced domestic, emotional or sexual abuse and have mental health problems.

We have been working with Women's Health Matters since 2016, raising over £1.6 million. Successful applications include The National Lottery Community Fund Reaching Communities programme, The Henry Smith Charity, Garfield Weston Foundation and BBC Children in Need. 

This grant from The Charles Plater Trust marks a milestone as our 50th successful application!

The Trust's funding will support Rosebuds, Women's Health Matters weekly, city-wide educational and peer support group for women who have had one or more children removed from their care.

Women attend Rosebuds for around six months. Each group is closed to enable women to build trust and positive support networks. The groups all complete educational sessions covering topics like healthly lifestyles, building rsilience, self-compassion and defining abuse. Women also co-produce sessions on topics they find meaningful and co-deliver them to peers. Guest speakers provide a break from educational sessions and give opportunities for women to meet other local organisations who can help when they leave Rosebuds.
