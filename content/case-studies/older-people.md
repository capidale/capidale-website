#### Case Study: Time for Tea, Age UK Wakefield

For several years, Age UK Wakefield has run a monthly ‘cuppa club’ in partnership with the Ridings Shopping Centre in Wakefield. The Ridings noticed that many older people would spend hours at the shopping centre, not speaking to anyone and sitting on their own.

They wanted to do something to help and so, with Age UK Wakefield’s support, they set up a monthly club in the atrium, where older people can come, have a free drink, watch a band and meet other people in the same situation. Age UK Wakefield and other organisations are on hand to offer help and support to those who need it.

Age UK Wakefield asked us to help them raise funds to extend the idea to other shopping centres across the district. We helped them develop an application to the National Lottery Community Fund, which successfully secured £280,119 to help them realise their ambition. Soon, Time for Tea will be running in five new shopping centres across the district, reaching 6,000 older people – and helping Age UK Wakefield identify those ‘hard to reach’ older people who need extra help.

#### Case Study: Age UK South Lakeland

We began working for Age UK South Lakeland in 2014, initially helping them secure a lottery grant of £499,000. They subsequently outsourced all their fundraising to us and, over the next five years, we raised almost £1.5 million for them, submitting 51 applications and securing 28 grants.

> "When I look at the annual costs, our spend is around 50% of what it would cost to have an experienced full time person. I believe it is very good value for money. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Capidale."
