Our roots are in the mental health sector, as Louise was previously Head of Fundraising for Rethink Mental Illness.

Before founding Capidale, Louise secured £16,000,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (now the National Lottery Community Fund) to set up the ground-breaking Time to Change anti-stigma campaign.

We have continued to successfully raise funds for many mental health charities and causes, including:

- Teesside Mind - £8,339,694
- Time to Change - £4,560,262
- The Cellar Trust - £1,554,665
- Mind (national) - £1,466,509
- National Survivor Users’ Network - £323,215

#### Case Study: Teesside Mind

In 2013 we were approached by Emma Howitt, Chief Executive of Teesside Mind (previously known as Middlesbrough & Stockton Mind) to help her with an application to the National Lottery Community Fund’s Ageing Better Programme. We worked with Emma for several months, helping to design and write the application. We eventually raised £5,995,432.

Since then, we have written 33 further applications, of which 24 have been successful. This includes:

- National Lottery Community Fund (Help Through Crisis) - £499,768
- NHS Charities Together - £238,000
- National Lottery Community Fund (Reaching Communities) - £217,149
- Comic Relief - £215,584
- Mind - £116,947
- BBC Children in Need - £57,639

We have helped many other local Minds with their fundraising, including Tameside, Oldham & Glossop Mind, Salford Mind and Scarborough Whitby and Ryedale Mind. We have also secured several large grants for national Mind, including from the Department for Education and Department of Health.

> “We have achieved an excellent success rate with Capidale. Getting expert help, when access to funds is so competitive, is crucial for us. I would absolutely recommend Capidale.”
