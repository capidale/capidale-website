We have a very strong track record in raising funds for charities supporting disadvantaged women and girls.

- Leeds Women's Counselling and Therapy Service - £2,514,629
- Women's Lives Leeds - £2,000,000
- Women's Health Matters - £1,644,780
- Kairos WWT - £867,862
- Wakefield Well Women’s Centre - £588,264

#### Case Study: Kairos WWT

A high proportion of our clients hear about us through a personal recommendation and that’s exactly how Kairos WWT found out about our work. Their new Chief Executive was concerned that a lot of grants were coming to an end and the budget was looking pretty slim.

Kairos is based in Coventry and supports women who are at risk of, or subject to sexual exploitation, including those involved in street-based prostitution. They keep women safe from harm and improve their stability and self-belief. They’re a small, but amazing team who we’re delighted to be working with.

We spent time at their premises and really got to know the team and their work. We looked at who had funded them in the past and carried out additional research into new funders whose guidelines closely matched Kairos’ work. 

To date, we’ve developed six funding applications for Kairos, totalling £867,862 over three years – and we’ve been successful with every single one!

#### Case Study: Women's Counselling and Therapy Service

Women's Counselling and Therapy Service (WCTS) helps women in Leeds recover from the trauma of rape, neglect and abuse. Director, Tessa Denham, contacted us for help in 2012, explaining that they were almost wholly reliant on statutory contracts, but their funding was under threat due to constraints in local authority spending.

We started by reviewing the charity’s work in-depth, paying particular attention to the needs of women receiving support and the outcomes they achieve. Next, we researched potential trusts and foundations to contact, identifying an initial 11 trusts with a very strong match to WCTS’s work. Our final preparatory step was to prepare a high-impact Case for Support, to show why a funder should give to WCTS, the issues their clients face and why WCTS is uniquely well placed to support them.

Since we began working with WCTS, we have developed 40 fundraising applications, 28 of which have been successful – raising over £2.4 million. Grants secured have included:

- The Henry Smith Charity - £168,911
- Comic Relief – £119,907
- Lloyds Bank Foundation - £46,622
- Ministry of Justice - £277,200
- BBC Children in Need – £106,707
- Pilgrim Trust – £44,383
