Whether you are a major charity needing extra capacity to write a multi-million pound fundraising bid, or a smaller charity wishing to expand your grant fundraising from a low base, we can help.

We have a highly successful track record. For example, since 2011, we have written 125 applications to the National Lottery Community Fund, 78% of which have been successful. So far, we have raised almost £40 million in Lottery funds for our clients.

Our approach works with other funders too. We have written 47 applications to the Henry Smith Charity, with a 77% success rate. And we have secured funding from Comic Relief, BBC Children in Need, Lloyds Bank Foundation, Garfield Weston, Dunhill Medical Trust, Rayne Foundation, Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, statutory funders and many, many smaller trusts and foundations.

We are deeply proud that over the last five years, on average we have raised £36.09 for every £1 charged in fundraising fees (£30.08 including VAT). This compares to a national average return on investment for trusts, foundations and lottery fundraising of £10.05 (Chartered Institute of Fundraising).

We base our success on working closely with clients as they develop their ideas. We carefully match their projects with potential funders and write highly persuasive, evidence-based applications that meet both parties’ needs.
