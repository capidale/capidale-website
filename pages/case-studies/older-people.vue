            We started working with Age UK South Lakeland in 2014 when their
            in-house fundraiser retired.
          </p>
          <p>
            We began by undertaking funder research which initially identified
            17 trusts, foundations and grant programmes with the potential to
            support them. Next, we wrote a high-impact Case for Support to
            differentiate their funding requests from other charities in the
            region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first fundraising application was to the Big Lottery Fund’s
            Reaching Communities programme, which successfully secured a
            five-year grant of £499,000. After which they outsourced all trusts
            fundraising to us.

              When I look at the annual costs, our spend is around 50% of what
              it would cost to have an experienced full time person. I believe
              it is very good value for money. I have no hesitation whatsoever
              in recommending Capidale.

            To date, we have written 45 fundraising applications to large and
            small funders, almost 60% of these have been successful – raising a
            total of over £1.4 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have helped many other local Age UKs with their fundraising,
            including Age UK Doncaster, Age UK Barrow & District, Age UK
            Carlisle & Eden and Age UK North East Lincolnshire.
