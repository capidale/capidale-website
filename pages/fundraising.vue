            Whether you are a major charity needing extra capacity to write a
            multi-million pound fundraising bid, or a smaller charity wishing to
            expand your grant fundraising from a low base, we can help.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a highly successful track record. For example, since 2011,
            we have written 61 large applications to The National Lottery
            Community Fund, successfully securing 72% of all funds requested.
            This compares to an industry average success rate of around 10%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our approach works with other funders too. In the last three years,
            we have written six applications to the Henry Smith Charity, five
            projects have been funded. And we have enjoyed success with Comic
            Relief, Children in Need, Lloyds Bank Foundation, Garfield Weston,
            Dunhill Medical Trust, Rayne Foundation, Esmée Fairbairn Foundation,
            statutory funders and many, many smaller trusts and foundations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are deeply proud to have raised an average £51.66 for every £1
            charged in fundraising fees. This compares to a national average
            return on investment for trusts, foundations and lottery fundraising
            of £8.36 (Institute of Fundraising).
          </p>
          <p>
            We base our success on working closely with clients as they develop
            their ideas. We carefully match their projects with potential
            funders and write highly persuasive, evidence-based applications
            that meet both parties’ needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Services we offer include developing a trusts and foundations
            strategy, researching funders, writing bids and preparing funder
            reports. We can also help you prepare a Case for Support, recruit
            fundraisers and provide coaching and mentoring.
