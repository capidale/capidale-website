            We are a Yorkshire-based, specialist fundraising and project
            evaluation consultancy. We help local and national charities measure
            and powerfully communicate their work to improve income generation
            and funder relationships.

                Louise’s first career was market research – she loved the
                research but was less enamoured about spending her days working
                on shower gel, cat food and frozen peas.

                the British Red Cross, as a corporate and then major donor
                fundraiser. She then became Head of Fundraising at Rethink, the
                mental health charity where she increased voluntary fundraising
                from £200,000 to over £2 million in just 5 years.
