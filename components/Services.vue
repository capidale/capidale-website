                  We have a highly successful track record. We have helped
                  smaller clients set up and grow their trusts and foundations
                  programmes and led multi-million pound grant applications for
                  major national charities. We will help you find funders with
                  interests matching your work and we will work with your to
                  develop successful grant applications.
